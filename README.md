# Seraph - Unofficial Hypixel Services

## Our Vision

Our objective is to empower the Hypixel community by providing complimentary access to comprehensive player statistics, tools for statistical analysis, and engaging platforms that foster community interaction.

## What We Offer

We provides the following services:

* **Cheater Tags (via API):** Our API analyses player data to identify accounts exhibiting suspicious behaviour, providing potential "cheater tags" for community awareness purposes. **This is not a definitive proof of cheating**.
* **Player Data (via API):** Access comprehensive statistics and historical data for Hypixel players through our API.
* **Client Data (via API):** Access to Minecraft client status & cosmetic data through our API.
* **Stats Website:** A website where players can easily search for and view detailed statistics for any Hypixel player.
* **Discord Bot:** A versatile Discord bot that allows server members to:
    * Look up player statistics directly within Discord.
    * Receive notifications for specific player events (e.g., reaching a milestone).
    * Access to server leaderboards.
* **Public API:** We offer a JWT token based API for public utilisation. To request access, Please visit https://seraph.si/developer. A Discord Account is required to signup. 

## Key Features
